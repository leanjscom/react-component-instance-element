# React Components, Instances and Elements

This is a simple set of exercises to introduce some React key concepts. The concepts your are going to learn are:
  - React Component
  - React Instance
  - React Element

You are also going to practise unit testing with React using:
  - Jest
  - Chai
  - React Test Utilities

## Installation

Make sure you have Node and git installed.

`git clone git@github.com:leanjscom/react-component-instance-element.git && cd react-component-instance-element && yarn instal`

##  Exercise

Execute in your console: `yarn test`

You need to fix the tests by editing this file /exercise/virtual-dom.spec.js. There are comments with hints in the file. The idea is to make you think of why those assertions work or not.

## Questions

1. When does React create Elements? Hint https://goo.gl/JTYuPH
2. The Virtual Dom is a tree of Elements, Instances, or Components?
3. When does React create Instances?
4. Do we ever create Instances? components = new MyComponent()
5. What is a detached Component?
